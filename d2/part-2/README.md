# TABLE READY

## Description 
We are planning to build a web portal for [Table Ready](http://www.tableready.net) that allows restaurant owners to efficiently manage their restaurantsâ€™ waitlist, reservations, customers, and employees with ease. In addition, our portal will integrate with another existing mobile app that customers use to add reservations, waitlist and check out restaurants. 

## Key Features
There are three types of targeted users for our app: restaurant managers, restaurant employees and Table Ready system admins.

#### System Admins
* View subscription trends and user statistics
* Add/Delete all existing users and restaurants. 
* Ability to view and perform operations on all UI pages of existing users and restaurants.

#### Restaurant Managers
* Add/Delete employees for the restaurants they own.
* View each restaurant employee's information.
* Edit the restaurant's information.
* Create and add a new restaurant they own.
* View/Add/Delete the menu of their restaurant.
* Subscription payment to Table Ready.

#### Restaurant Employees
* View the current status of the restaurant this employee works for, including
  * the current occupancy states for each table;
  * the current waitlist status,
    * number of groups on the waitlist;
    * for each group on the waitlist, ability to view the number of guest, their estimated arrival time, and the date of waitlisting. 
* Update the restaurant current state.
	* Employees that are using this software can drag one of the waitlist card to an empty table with enough capacity, indicating one of the group on the waitlist has been served. The status of that group's waitlist card will change from "not served" to "served". 
	* After they finish their meal, employees can empty the occupied table, and remove the waitlist card that have been served.
