- Development process shouldn’t discuss actual code choices (such as libraries) but rather how you work as a team. Many of your decisions are product related
- Description of product is lacking the ‘why’ - e.g. why is a web portal necessary? Does it not already exist? etc.

- I won’t ding you twice for the description
- Who chose the license and why ? What impact does it have on your partner who is a private company?
- Losing (small) marks on the instructions here as I had to guess the login/password since signup was disabled
- Great job on the product!
